            HOW RUST HANDLES INTEGER OVERFLOW:
            If a variable has a value changed outside its storable range then we get an overflow.
            In normal debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow, these overflows will cause 
            the program to panic at runtime = the program exits without an error

            In release mode, Rust doesn't include checks for integer overflow; it instead does two's complement
            wrapping - this allows the program to not panic at runtime but may cause variables to have a value you
            weren't expecting.
            To handle the possibility of overflow we can use families of methods that the std lib provides on 
            primitive numeric types:
                - wrap with wrapping_* methods such as wrapping_add
                - return None if there's an overflow with the checked_* methods
                - return the value and a boolean indicating if there was an overflow with overflowing_* methods
                - saturate at the value's min or max values with saturating_* methods
